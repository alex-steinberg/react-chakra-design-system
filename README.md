# React Starter App

Starter app for my React projects that contains the bare essentials:

ðŸ‘‰[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for bundling and dev server.
ðŸ‘‰[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) as a modern alternative to Jest.
ðŸ‘‰[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for testing React components.
ðŸ‘‰[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) for UI. With tools like these available, there isn't a
reason one can't build a design system from the word go. Dark mode out-the-box.
ðŸ‘‰[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Okay, this isn't essential, but why not?
ðŸ‘‰Basic CI using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions)

No server, routing, e2e tests ... yet.

## Usage

Install Node.js [directly](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or using a [version manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

From the root of this project, install dependencies:

    npm install

Run the app:

    npm start

Open a browser window and go to http://localhost:5173/ to use.

## Testing

Run tests:

    npm test

## Building for production

Build the app:

    npm run build

I imagine there's more to this, and will be sure to update once I've pushed to prod!
